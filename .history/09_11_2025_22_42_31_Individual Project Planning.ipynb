    "### Proposed Method: Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "#### Why is this method appropriate?\n",
    "This method is appropriate because we have one predictor (experience) and one response (playtime), making simple linear regression appropriate. It allows us to predict playtime, a numerical variable, and assess the strength and direction of the relationship between experience and total hours played.\n",
    "#### Which assumptions are required, if any, to apply the method selected?\n",
    "To apply this method, we must assume that the relationship between player experience and total hours played is approximately linear. This is to prevent underfitting which means that the model/predicted values do not match the observed values very well. We also assume that the observations are independent and do not influence each other. \n",
    "#### What are the potential limitations or weaknesses of the method selected\n",
    "A key limitation of linear regression is that it may not capture nonlinear or complex relationships between player experience and total playtime. It can also be sensitive to outliers or skewed data, which may distort the best-fit line and lead to less reliable predictions.\n",
    "#### How are you going to compare and select the model?\n",
    "The model will be compared and selected based on its predictive accuracy, using the Root Mean Square Prediction Error (RMSPE) as the main evaluation metric. RMSPE measures how far the predicted values are, on average, from the actual values in the testing set. A lower RMSPE indicates that the model’s predictions are closer to the real data, meaning it performs better and generalizes more accurately to unseen players. By comparing the RMSPE values of different models, the one with the lowest RMSPE will be chosen as the best model, as it provides the most reliable predictions of total playtime based on player experience.\n",
    "#### How are you going to process the data to apply the model? For example: Are you splitting the data? How? How many splits? What proportions will you use for the splits? At what stage will you split? Will there be a validation set? Will you use cross validation?\n",
    "Before applying the model, the dataset will preprocessed and then split into training and testing sets, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% for testing. The split will occur after all data cleaning steps are complete but before fitting the model. The training set will be used to build the linear regression model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its predictive performance. To ensure reliability and minimize overfitting, 5-fold cross-validation will also be applied to the training data, allowing the model’s performance to be assessed across multiple subsets before final evaluation on the test set. There will not be a separate validation set because 5-fold cross-validation on the training data will serve as the validation process."
