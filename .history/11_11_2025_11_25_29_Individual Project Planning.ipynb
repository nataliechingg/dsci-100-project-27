    "### Proposed Method: Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "#### Why is this method appropriate?\n",
    "This method is appropriate because we have one predictor (experience) and one response (playtime), making simple linear regression appropriate. It allows us to predict playtime, a numerical variable, and assess the strength and direction of the relationship between experience and total hours played.\n",
    "#### Which assumptions are required, if any, to apply the method selected?\n",
    "We must assume that the relationship between player experience and total hours played is approximately linear to prevent underfitting.\n",
    "#### What are the potential limitations or weaknesses of the method selected\n",
    "A key limitation of linear regression is that it may miss nonlinear or complex relationships and can be sensitive to outliers or skewed data, reducing prediction reliability.\n",
    "#### How are you going to compare and select the model?\n",
    "The model will be evaluated using Root Mean Square Prediction Error (RMSPE), which measures the average difference between predicted and actual values. A lower RMSPE indicates better predictive accuracy, so the model with the lowest RMSPE will be selected as the most reliable for predicting playtime from player experience.\n",
    "#### How are you going to process the data to apply the model? For example: Are you splitting the data? How? How many splits? What proportions will you use for the splits? At what stage will you split? Will there be a validation set? Will you use cross validation?\n",
    "The dataset will be preprocessed and split into 70% training and 30% testing sets after cleaning. The training set will build the linear regression model, and the testing set will evaluate its performance. To ensure reliability and reduce overfitting, 5-fold cross-validation will be applied to the training data, serving as the validation process without needing a separate validation set."
